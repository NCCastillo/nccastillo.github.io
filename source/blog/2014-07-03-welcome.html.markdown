Hello there, Guess what?  Today marks the start of my blog being launched.  Ok,  not the most exciting
news since a lot of people start blogs every day but exciting enough for me as this is a goal I have
set for myself this year.

The main reasons for starting this blog is for educational purposes.  The more I write and explain technical
concepts, the more "second" learning I do.  It is an amazing feeling when something sticks especially when
you struggle with something initially.

**Goals for this Blog:**

* 1) Write about programming concepts - Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and other languages I am interested in.
* 2) Growth Engineering - All about mindset and how it relates to learning.
* 3) Taking notes for books I read.

I truly believe one of the secrets to being successful is constant learning.  We are always learning
either directly or indirectly from our experiences, failures, achievements and life in general.  By writing
I am hoping to learn more about myself, grow as a Software Developer and help others by sharing what I learn.
