In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### My skills\r\nInsert my skills here...\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nContact details here:\r\nEmail\r\nTwitter\r\nLinkedin\r\nGithub\r\nPhone\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
