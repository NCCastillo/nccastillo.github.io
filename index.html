<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Nestor. I like to build things and I am a recent graduate from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp Chicago.</a></p>

<p>In 2003 I graduated from <a href="http://www.barry.edu/">Barry Univeristy</a> with a BSc in Computer Information Sciences.  I have always been curious about how things are built.  This couriosity naturally lead me to all things computer related. Over the years I had the opportunity to work in several IT support roles in the Information Technology field, however never as a developer.  With my curiosity in hand I finally took the leap to become a Web Developer.  I am excited for the new opportunites that lie ahead and I am excited to keep learning in this vast world of programming.</p>
<h3>
<a name="my-goals" class="anchor" href="#my-goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h3>
<p>
 Looking for an opportunity to work in an environment where my co-workers are excited about the work they are
doing, look forward to continuous learning and take pride in the code they write. I would like to give back by
mentoring other beginners, being involved in local meet ups and contributing to the dev community.
